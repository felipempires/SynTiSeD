# SynTiSeD - Synthetic Time Series Data Generator

## Overview
This is the simulation framework to generate synthetic times series data out of real world ground truth data.

## Features
SynTiSeD is the simulation framework for creating smart meter data based on real world data. Since smart meter data is composed of many different individual appliances, the data for each appliance is required first. For this repository, the appliances of a household in the GeLaP dataset [[1]](#1) were sequenced so that power consumption patterns are available for each appliance. The sequencing process also extracted when each appliance consumed energy in the real smart meter data, resulting in activity sequences. In SynTiSeD, different residents can be created for a household, which then perform action sequences and switch on appliances which then consume energy. The smart meter data is generated by SynTiSeD on a daily basis, whereby it is possible to specify which day to start from.
